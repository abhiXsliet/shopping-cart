# Shopping Cart (Ecomzy)

The Shopping Cart, also known as [Ecomzy](https://ecomzy-shopping-cart.vercel.app/
), is a simple web application built during [web development bootcamp](https://github.com/abhiXsliet/webDevelopment-Bootcamp) to understand the concept of store and slices in React.js. It demonstrates the basic functionality of a shopping cart, allowing users to add products, adjust quantities, and calculate the total price. The application utilizes React, HTML, and CSS (Tailwind) to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. [EXPLORE!](https://ecomzy-shopping-cart.vercel.app/)
